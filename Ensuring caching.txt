Ensuring Caching

Caching in computing involves using a high-speed storage layer to store a portion of data temporarily, 
enabling quicker access for future requests compared to accessing the primary storage directly. This 
method efficiently recycles previously fetched or processed data. Typically, cached data resides on 
fast-access hardware like RAM and often integrates with software. The primary goal is to enhance data 
retrieval speed by minimizing reliance on slower underlying storage systems. Unlike databases that store 
complete and long-lasting elements, caches trade storage capacity for performance by holding a transient 
subset of data.
